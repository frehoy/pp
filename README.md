# pp

Python project skeleton. All you need is a python3 install, from python.org or homebrew or whatever.

Add packages you need to `requirements.txt`, run `make env` to create a virtual env with those package.
Activate the env with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Run `deactivate` to escape from the env.

The makefile also install a `pp` command you can call when the venv is activated so you can use your libs from anywhere.

Happy hacking
